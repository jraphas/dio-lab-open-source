## üòÅ *Hello, what's up?*

I'm Raphael, a technology enthusiast who likes play games, watch series/movies/videos in general, go out exercise at park and explore many types of food. As a lifelong learner, I'm an aspiring Data Engineer and also a Graduated in Computer Engineering.
In my work journey, I had experience as intern in user support about one year and half, as well as six months at Big Data Developer with Logstash, ElasticSearch and Kibana tools. As 2+ years working with Oracle BRM, competences in C, Shell Script and SQL grew up. The graduation work was important to develop skills related to Data and AI using Python, Pandas and Scikit-Learn.
